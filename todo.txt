[00:35:28] Badspot: You guys are like regular blockheads.
[00:35:36] Badspot: And I like that.
[00:47:09] Badspot: I have 350 more things to download
[00:58:52] Badspot: 220

[01:02:55] Badspot: 200 more files
[01:03:39] Badspot: i haven't joined the server yet
[01:06:52] Badspot: oh is that a dab emote?
[01:06:59] Badspot: poor design having the arms line up
[01:07:14] Badspot: looks like a penguin holding a rocket launcher 
[01:08:50] Badspot: The block rendering engine would require complete restructuring to advance further
[01:08:59] Badspot: and it's just not motivating in the age of so many block games
[01:09:38] Badspot: The "engine" myth is a result of marketing
[01:10:04] Badspot: There is no engine that would do what blockland needs to do
[01:12:45] Badspot: < 100
[01:15:21] Badspot: I'm kind of done with pax
[01:15:49] Badspot: It's expensive and a lot of work to show a game there
[01:15:59] Badspot: as far as attending, i'm not really a fan boy for video games
[01:16:24] Badspot: if i was going to show a game at pax, I'd probably walk around with a laptop stand to show people
[01:16:31] Badspot: instead of spending like $2k on a booth
